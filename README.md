-This project was made for the FeraMade FrontEnd test.

-The project is made using Angular 5, and Saas

-The project uses the Front End Library of Material Angular

-For starting the project, is needed to make an "npm install" on the terminal, and then a "ng-serve".

-The login and the create user are fully functionals using the NOSql from firebase, in this way the validations of the
created user and the login are real.

-The information of the landing page are fetched from a Json file, so it was needed to create a Service to get the information

-The carousel-like slider was made all by myself and is functional with the information of the Json
(it's good to mention that the slider is not generic and in order for it to be generic, some adaptations are needed to calculate
all the posible use cases, but in this example is made to work with the provided Json structure)

-All the requirements of the test are being treated in this test system
